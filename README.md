# Alternate Version of ToastUI Editor
> This is an alternative version of a GFM Markdown WYSIWYG Editor

This version is optimized so that codeblocks can contain HTML content to be highlighted and therefore will not be escaped. 

Most users should not use this package. Instead, most users should use [the original version](https://github.com/nhnent/tui.editor).
